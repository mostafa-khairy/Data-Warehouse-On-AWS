# Data-Warehouse-On-AWS

# introduction

- A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

- As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.


# How to run 
- opening terminal and execute the following 
```
python create_tables.py
```
```
python etl.py
```



# An explanation of the files in the repository 
1. sql_queries.py : contains all sql statements used in this project. 
2. create_tables.py : create fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
3. etl.py : load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into analytics tables on Redshift.
4. dwh.cfg : onfiguration file for Redshift, IAM and S3.



# Data 
 two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
 
- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json




# Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

# Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.
